            <h2>Understanding Your Loan EMI</h2>
            <p>Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) is the fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. EMIs are used to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full.</p>
            <p>Our Loan/EMI Calculator helps you quickly and accurately determine your monthly payments. By simply entering the total loan amount, the annual interest rate, and the loan tenure in years, you can get an instant estimate. This is an essential tool for anyone considering a home loan, car loan, or personal loan, as it helps in understanding the financial commitment involved.</p>

            <h3>How to Use the Calculator</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> Enter the principal loan amount you wish to borrow.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Input the annual interest rate charged by the lender.</li>
                <li><strong>Loan Tenure:</strong> Provide the total duration of the loan in years.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you click "Calculate," the tool will display your monthly EMI. This allows you to compare different loan options and make an informed decision that fits your budget.</p>
